 Assignment: Build a RAG-Based Retrieval System with LLM Integration 
Objective:
You are tasked with building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can extract structured information from a large PDF document based on user queries.

The goal is to input a question, retrieve the relevant information from the PDF, and output a structured and meaningful response.

Problem Statement:
Given a large, real-world PDF document, build a system that:

Accepts a user query (e.g., "What are the eligibility criteria for Medicare Advantage Plans?")

Retrieves the most relevant sections from the PDF.

Implement a mechanism for deciding the chunk size suited for best output generation. So the generated chunk size is dynamic in nature
i.e. generated by the logic and not pre-defined by the user. Make sure to use some strong metrics for your chunk size evaluation.

Uses an LLM to generate a structured, clean, and contextually accurate answer(Try to work with opensource / Freely available llm models).

Returns the output in a structured JSON format.

Requirements:
Use a RAG-based framework: Retrieval and Generation should be separated clearly.

Use any open source / Free LLM models .

Create a simple API (using FastAPI or any other web framework) that:

Accepts a user query.

Runs the retrieval + generation pipeline.

Returns a structured JSON response.

Ensure that for every response, the source chunk/page from the PDF is also linked.


PDF Document:  [text](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/10050-medicare-and-you.pdf)

Example Input/Output:
Input Query:

"What are the important deadlines for Medicare enrollment?"



{
  "answer": "Medicare enrollment begins on October 15 and ends on December 7 each year...",
  "source_page": 15,
  "confidence_score": 0.92
  "chunk_size": 230
}


Deliverables:
Working API endpoint(s) that can accept a query and return the structured answer.

Clear instructions (README) on how to run the project locally.

Code and environment setup (requirements.txt).


Additional Notes:

Handle edge cases like empty queries or no relevant data found.

You are free to choose vector DBs, embedding models, or chunking strategies as appropriate.

Maintain a better coding standard.
